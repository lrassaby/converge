# Background
Research suggests that ships traveling in convoy can gain 10 - 20% fuel efficiency. Even though ships tend to travel the same routes, they don't take advantage of these potential savings.

The shipping industry spends around $4.37 trillion on fuel per year, accounting for around half of their costs, and we estimate that $18 billion can be saved annually through convoys.

# Converge
By facilitating the formation and management of convoys, we will help the shipping industry reduce fuel costs and environmental impact.
